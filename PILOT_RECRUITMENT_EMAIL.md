# TeachAssist v0.1 - Pilot Teacher Recruitment Email

## Version 1: Full Email (Initial Outreach)

**Subject:** Pilot TeachAssist: AI that respects teacher judgment (2-3 weeks, Feb 2026)

---

Hi [Teacher Name],

I'm reaching out because you're exactly the kind of teacher whose feedback could shape something meaningful.

**What is TeachAssist?**

It's an AI assistant built specifically for teachers, with one core principle: **you decide, AI assists.**

Unlike generic AI tools that feel disconnected from teaching, TeachAssist:

1. **Knows your curriculum** - Upload your standards, textbooks, and lesson plans. Ask questions and get grounded answers (with citations so you can verify).

2. **Has an "Inner Council"** - Four specialized AI advisors who give structured feedback:
   - 📚 Standards Guardian (curriculum alignment)
   - 🎯 Differentiation Advocate (equity & accessibility)
   - 🏃 Practical Realist (time & feasibility)
   - 📊 Assessment Architect (rubrics & feedback)

3. **Respects your authority** - No AI grading (ever). No replacing your judgment. Just support for the decisions you already make.

**Why a pilot?**

We've built v0.1 based on teacher input, but we need 5-8 teachers to:
- Try it with real curriculum materials
- Tell us what works (and what doesn't)
- Help us prioritize what to build next
- Shape this into something teachers actually want

**What's the commitment?**

- **Setup:** 15 minutes (we'll help)
- **Usage:** Use it however you'd naturally use it (no minimum required)
- **Feedback:** 15-minute check-in call each week (3 weeks total)
- **Timeline:** February 2026 (flexible start date)

**What's in it for you?**

- **Early access** - Shape a tool before it's widely released
- **Free API credits** - We'll cover the first $50 of AI usage
- **Priority feature requests** - Your needs drive our roadmap
- **Network** - Connect with other innovative teachers in the pilot

**Important details:**

✅ **Privacy-first:** Everything runs locally on your computer. We never see your documents.

✅ **No student data:** Never upload student work or PII. Only curriculum materials.

✅ **Teacher-tested:** Built by teachers, for teachers. We're educators ourselves.

✅ **Open to feedback:** If something's broken or confusing, we want to know immediately.

**Requirements:**

- Mac or Windows computer (admin access to install software)
- Comfort with basic tech (if you can install apps, you're fine)
- Curriculum documents you'd like to work with (PDFs, Word docs)
- About 1-2 hours over 3 weeks (setup + check-ins)

**Interested?**

Reply with:
1. Your grade level and subject area
2. What teaching task you'd most want help with
3. Your available start date in February

Or if you have questions, just reply - I'm happy to chat.

**Not interested?**

No worries! If you know another teacher who might be interested, feel free to forward this email.

P.S. Here's a quick example: A pilot teacher uploaded their 9th grade physics standards and asked "How should I teach Newton's Laws to meet NGSS HS-PS2-1?" The Standards Guardian advisor noticed a potential mismatch with grade-level expectations and suggested specific activities. The teacher said it saved 30 minutes of standards-checking. That's the kind of support we're building.

## Version 4: Personal Invitation (Warm Referral)

**Subject:** Would you pilot TeachAssist with me? (Teacher AI tool)

---

Hi [Teacher Name],

Hope your semester is going well!

I wanted to reach out personally because I think you'd be perfect for something we're launching.

We've built an AI assistant specifically for teachers (I've been working with the team as an advisor/tester), and we're looking for 5-8 teachers to pilot it in February.

**What makes it different:**

Unlike ChatGPT or generic AI, this is built around how teachers actually work:

1. You upload your curriculum materials (standards, textbooks, unit plans)
2. You ask questions and get answers grounded in YOUR sources (with citations)
3. You can consult "Inner Council" advisors who give structured feedback:
   - Standards Guardian (curriculum alignment)
   - Differentiation Advocate (equity & accessibility)
   - Practical Realist (time & feasibility)
   - Assessment Architect (rubrics & feedback)

The core principle: **You decide, AI assists.** No AI grading, no replacing teacher judgment.

**I'm asking you specifically because:**

[Personal reason - e.g., "I know you're thoughtful about curriculum alignment and I think the Standards Guardian would be really useful for you" or "You mentioned wanting better tools for differentiation" or "You always have great feedback and I trust your judgment"]

**What's involved:**

- 15-minute setup (I can walk you through it if you want)
- Use it however you'd naturally use it (no minimum required)
- Three 15-minute check-in calls (weekly in February)
- Be honest about what works and what doesn't

**What you get:**

- Early access before wider release
- $50 in free API credits
- Direct influence on what gets built next
- Connect with other innovative teachers

**Important:**

- Privacy-first (everything runs locally)
- No student data (only curriculum materials)
- Built BY teachers (I'm one of the advisors)
- Open to honest feedback (if it's not working, we want to know!)

Would you be interested? I think your feedback would be invaluable, and I'd love to have you in the pilot group.

Reply with any questions, or if you're in, just let me know your grade/subject and what teaching challenge you'd most want help with.

Thanks for considering!

[Your Name]

P.S. If February doesn't work but you're interested, let me know - we can probably work something out.

## FAQ (Copy-Paste Responses)

### Q: "How much does it cost?"

The software is free (open source). There is a small API cost for the AI (Claude), which we estimate at $5-20/month for typical pilot usage. **We'll cover your first $50**, so cost shouldn't be a barrier during the pilot.

### Q: "What if I'm not very tech-savvy?"

If you can install apps on your computer and navigate a web browser, you'll be fine! The setup guide is step-by-step (15 minutes), and we'll provide support. Several pilot teachers have said the setup was easier than expected.

### Q: "Can I use it with my students?"

Not yet! v0.1 is for *teacher* use only (planning, curriculum work, professional tasks). **Never upload student work or PII.** Future versions may include student-facing features, but that's not part of this pilot.

### Q: "What if it doesn't work or I don't like it?"

Totally fine! We want honest feedback. If something's broken, confusing, or not useful, that's exactly what we need to know. You can stop participating anytime, no questions asked.

### Q: "Will this replace teachers?"

Absolutely not. TeachAssist is built on the principle that teachers are irreplaceable. AI assists, you decide. We're teachers ourselves and deeply believe in teacher judgment.

### Q: "How do I know my data is safe?"

Everything runs locally on your computer. Your documents never leave your machine. The only thing sent to the AI service is your questions + relevant excerpts (not full documents). We never see your data. Full details in the setup guide.

### Q: "What subjects/grades does it work with?"

All subjects and grades! We've designed it to be curriculum-agnostic. Pilot teachers span elementary to high school, across STEM, humanities, arts, and more.

### Q: "I have a Mac/Windows - will it work?"

Yes! The setup guide covers both Mac and Windows with step-by-step instructions for each.

### Q: "Can I share this with other teachers?"

Please do! We'd love referrals to teachers who'd give thoughtful feedback. Just forward the email or have them reach out directly.
