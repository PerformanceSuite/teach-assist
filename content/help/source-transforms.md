# Using Source Transforms

Source transforms let you convert and view your uploaded materials in different formats, making them more useful for specific tasks.

## What Are Source Transforms?

Transforms take your uploaded content and restructure it for different purposes:

- Summarize lengthy documents
- Extract key points or lists
- Create study guides from textbook chapters
- Generate question banks from standards

## Available Transforms

### Summary Transform

Condense lengthy documents into digestible overviews.

**Use when:**
- You need a quick refresher on a long document
- Preparing for a meeting about curriculum
- Sharing highlights with colleagues

**Example:**
> Transform: Summarize "NGSS 8th Grade Standards"
>
> Result: A 1-page overview of key performance expectations, science practices, and crosscutting concepts.

### Key Points Extract

Pull out the main ideas, objectives, or requirements.

**Use when:**
- Identifying essential learning targets
- Creating lesson objectives
- Building assessment blueprints

**Example:**
> Transform: Extract key points from "UbD Unit Template"
>
> Result: Bulleted list of stage 1 goals, stage 2 assessments, and stage 3 activities.

### Question Generation

Create questions based on content.

**Use when:**
- Building formative assessments
- Creating discussion prompts
- Developing study guides

**Example:**
> Transform: Generate questions from "Forces and Motion Chapter"
>
> Result: Mix of recall, comprehension, and application questions.

### Checklist Conversion

Turn requirements or standards into actionable checklists.

**Use when:**
- Planning lesson coverage
- Tracking standard alignment
- Creating teacher prep lists

**Example:**
> Transform: Create checklist from "IEP Accommodations"
>
> Result: Checkbox list of required accommodations for the student.

## How to Use Transforms

1. **Select a source** from your knowledge base
2. **Choose a transform** from the available options
3. **Review the output** - transforms are drafts, not final products
4. **Edit as needed** - add your professional judgment

## Transform Limitations

**Transforms are starting points, not finished products.**

- Always review and edit output
- Transforms may miss nuance or context
- Your professional judgment is essential
- Original source remains unchanged

**Transforms don't:**
- Replace careful reading of sources
- Catch every important detail
- Understand your specific classroom context

## Best Practices

**Choose the right transform**
Match the transform to your actual need.

**Start with clean sources**
Well-organized uploads produce better transforms.

**Iterate**
Try different transforms on the same source for different purposes.

**Combine with Council**
Use transforms as input for Inner Council consultations.

## Example Workflow

**Goal:** Prepare for a unit on forces

1. **Upload** NGSS standards for physical science
2. **Transform** to key points extract
3. **Review** the extracted learning objectives
4. **Upload** your existing unit plan
5. **Ask grounded chat** "How does my unit align with these objectives?"
6. **Consult** Standards Guardian for alignment check
7. **Transform** standards to checklist for tracking coverage

## Transforms vs. Grounded Chat

| Feature | Transforms | Grounded Chat |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| Purpose | Restructure content | Answer questions |
| Input | Entire document | Specific query |
| Output | Formatted view | Conversational response |
| Best for | Document processing | Information retrieval |

Use transforms to prepare content, then use chat to explore it.
