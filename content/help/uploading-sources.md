# Uploading Curriculum Sources

Your knowledge base is the foundation of TeachAssist. The more relevant materials you upload, the better your grounded answers will be.

## Supported File Types

| Format | Extension | Best For |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| PDF | .pdf | Standards documents, textbook chapters |
| Word | .docx | Lesson plans, unit plans |
| Text | .txt | Simple notes, outlines |
| Markdown | .md | Structured documentation |

## What to Upload

**Foundation Documents (upload first)**
- State or national curriculum standards
- District curriculum guides
- Scope and sequence documents

**Planning Materials**
- Unit plans and lesson plans
- Teaching frameworks (UbD templates, 5E models)
- Pacing guides

**Student Support**
- Anonymized IEPs and 504 plans
- Differentiation strategy guides
- Accommodation reference sheets

**Professional Resources**
- PD materials and notes
- Research articles
- Best practices guides

## How to Upload

1. **Click "Upload Sources"** on the home page, or press `Cmd+U`
2. **Select your file** from the file picker
3. **Add a descriptive title** (this helps you find it later)
4. **Wait for processing** (typically 10-30 seconds)

## Writing Good Titles

Titles help you find sources later and help TeachAssist understand context.

**Good titles:**
- "NGSS 8th Grade Physical Science Standards"
- "UbD Unit Template - Forces and Motion"
- "IEP Accommodation Strategies (Anonymized)"

**Less helpful titles:**
- "standards.pdf"
- "Document 1"
- "untitled"

## Processing: What Happens

When you upload a document:

1. **Text Extraction** - Content is pulled from the document
2. **Chunking** - Long documents split into searchable sections
3. **Embedding** - Each chunk converted to semantic vectors
4. **Indexing** - Added to your searchable knowledge base

This process enables semantic search - finding content by meaning, not just keywords.

## After Upload

Once processed, your source is immediately available for:

- **Grounded Chat** - Ask questions about the content
- **Inner Council** - Advisors can reference the material
- **Search** - Find specific information quickly

## Organizing Multiple Sources

Upload related documents together and use consistent naming:

```
8th Grade Science/
  - NGSS Standards - Grade 8 Physical Science
  - Unit 1 - Forces and Motion Plan
  - Unit 1 - Assessment Rubric
  - Forces Lab Safety Guidelines
```

## Troubleshooting

**Upload fails:**
- Check file size (max 50MB)
- Try a different format (convert to PDF)
- Ensure file isn't password-protected

**Processing takes too long:**
- Large documents take longer
- Complex PDFs with images take longer
- Try uploading just the text content

**Content not searchable:**
- Some scanned PDFs need OCR
- Image-heavy documents may have less text
- Check that the file contains actual text
