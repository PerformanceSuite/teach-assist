# Understanding Citations

Every TeachAssist answer cites the source documents it used. This transparency helps you trust and verify the information.

## Why Citations Matter

**Verifiability**
You can check that the AI accurately represents your sources.

**Traceability**
Know exactly where information comes from.

**No Hallucinations**
If it's not in your sources, TeachAssist won't make it up.

**Professional Use**
You can confidently use information knowing its origin.

## Citation Format

Citations appear after relevant statements in responses:

> "Students should demonstrate understanding of Newton's Third Law by describing paired forces in real-world scenarios." *[NGSS Standards - Grade 8, Section 3.2]*

The citation includes:
- **Document title** - Which source
- **Section reference** - Where in the document

## Reading Citations

**Single Citation**
Information from one source:

> "Extended time of 1.5x is recommended for assessments." *[IEP - Student A]*

**Multiple Citations**
Information synthesized from several sources:

> "The unit should address both PS2.A (Forces and Motion) standards and the district pacing guide timeline of 3 weeks." *[NGSS Standards][District Pacing Guide]*

**Inline vs. Block Citations**
- Inline citations appear within text
- Block citations may appear at the end of a section for broader references

## Verifying Information

1. **Click the citation** (when clickable) to jump to the source
2. **Read the surrounding context** in the original document
3. **Confirm accuracy** - Does the source say what the response claims?

## When to Be Extra Careful

**Synthesized Information**
When TeachAssist combines multiple sources, double-check each:

> "Based on the standards and lesson template, the learning objective should focus on force diagrams." *[NGSS Standards][UbD Template]*

Check both documents to confirm the synthesis is accurate.

**Paraphrased Content**
TeachAssist paraphrases for clarity. Verify the original wording if precision matters.

**Numerical Data**
Always verify numbers, dates, and specific figures against the source.

## Citation Confidence

TeachAssist indicates confidence levels:

**High Confidence**
> "The standard explicitly states..." *[Source]*

**Moderate Confidence**
> "Based on the document, this likely means..." *[Source]*

**Low Confidence**
> "The source doesn't directly address this, but related content suggests..." *[Source]*

## Missing Citations

If you see an answer without citations:

- The information may be general (not source-specific)
- Ask TeachAssist: "What source is this from?"
- Consider if the question requires uploaded content

## Building Better Citations

**Upload specific documents**
More targeted sources = more precise citations.

**Use descriptive titles**
Helps you recognize citations at a glance.

**Organize by topic**
Related documents cited together make more sense.

## Example: Working with Citations

**Question:** "What should students know about forces before starting the unit?"

**Response:**
> According to your uploaded standards, students should have prior knowledge of:
>
> 1. "Basic understanding of motion concepts (speed, direction)" *[NGSS Standards, Prior Knowledge section]*
> 2. "Ability to create and interpret graphs of motion" *[Unit 1 Prerequisite Skills]*
> 3. "Familiarity with scientific vocabulary including 'variable' and 'control'" *[District Science Framework]*

You can verify each numbered item against its cited source.
