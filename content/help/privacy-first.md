# Privacy-First Design

TeachAssist is built from the ground up with student privacy as the top priority.

## FERPA Compliance

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) protects student education records. TeachAssist supports compliance through:

**Local Data Storage**
- All documents stored on your local machine
- No automatic cloud uploads
- You control what data exists and when it's deleted

**No Student Identifiers Required**
- TeachAssist works without student names
- Use anonymized labels: "Student A", "Learner 1"
- Never requires personally identifiable information

**Teacher-Controlled Access**
- Only you access your TeachAssist instance
- No multi-user sharing of student data
- No third-party data transfers

## COPPA Considerations

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) adds protections for students under 13. TeachAssist addresses this by:

- Not collecting any student data directly
- Working only with teacher-uploaded materials
- Never interacting with students
- Keeping all processing local

## What to Upload Safely

**Safe to Upload:**
- Curriculum standards (public documents)
- Lesson plans and unit plans
- Teaching frameworks (UbD, 5E, etc.)
- Anonymized IEPs (student name removed)
- General accommodation guidelines
- Assessment rubrics

**Anonymize Before Uploading:**
- IEPs and 504 plans - remove names, DOB, addresses
- Student work samples - remove identifying information
- Class rosters - use student numbers or pseudonyms

**Never Upload:**
- Student names with grades
- Social security numbers
- Home addresses or contact information
- Medical diagnoses with student names
- Disciplinary records

## The No-Grading Guardrail

TeachAssist has a hard-coded boundary: **it will never grade student work**.

This protects students from:
- Algorithmic bias in assessment
- Lack of human judgment in evaluation
- Removal of teacher professional expertise

TeachAssist can help you:
- Draft feedback comments (you review and edit)
- Align rubrics to standards
- Suggest differentiation strategies
- Generate narrative report card starters

You always make the final call.

## Data Minimization

TeachAssist follows the principle of collecting only what's needed:

- No analytics or usage tracking
- No personal teacher data required
- Session data cleared on close
- You can delete any stored content anytime

## Practical Privacy Workflow

1. **Review before uploading** - Check documents for student names
2. **Use find-and-replace** - Replace names with "Student A", "Student B"
3. **Remove dates** - DOB and specific dates aren't needed
4. **Focus on strategies** - Upload accommodation types, not specific student plans
