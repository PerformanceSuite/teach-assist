# Entering Student Data (FERPA-safe)

TeachAssist is designed to generate narrative comments while protecting student privacy. This guide explains how to enter data safely.

## The Privacy-First Approach

TeachAssist uses a **de-identified data model**:

- No student names required
- No persistent student records
- Data exists only for the current session
- You maintain all identifying information separately

## How to Enter Data

### Step 1: Use Anonymous Identifiers

Instead of student names, use:

**Recommended formats:**
- `Student_A`, `Student_B`
- `Learner_1`, `Learner_2`
- Your own ID system (student numbers without names)

**Do NOT use:**
- Full names
- First names (even alone can be identifying)
- Initials with other identifying info

### Step 2: Enter Achievement Levels

For each criterion or standard:

**Numerical scales:**
```
Criterion A: 5
Criterion B: 6
Criterion C: 4
```

**Descriptor-based:**
```
Criterion A: Developing
Criterion B: Proficient
Criterion C: Beginning
```

### Step 3: Add Context (Optional)

Brief notes that inform the narrative:

**Safe context:**
- "Strong in lab work"
- "Needs support with written expression"
- "Exceeded expectations in final project"

**Avoid:**
- Names of other students
- Specific medical information
- Disciplinary references

## Example Data Entry

**IB MYP Science Report:**

```
Student ID: Student_A
Term: Term 2

Criterion A (Knowing and Understanding): 6
Criterion B (Inquiring and Designing): 5
Criterion C (Processing and Evaluating): 4
Criterion D (Reflecting): 5

Notes: Strong conceptual understanding, needs support
with data analysis
```

## FERPA Compliance

### What FERPA Requires

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act protects:
- Personally identifiable information (PII)
- Education records
- Student academic information

### How TeachAssist Complies

**No PII storage:**
- Anonymous identifiers only
- No name fields
- No persistent student database

**Session-based data:**
- Achievement data exists only during your session
- Nothing saved to server
- You control all data

**Local processing:**
- Data doesn't leave your machine
- No cloud storage of student information
- No third-party access

## Your Responsibility

While TeachAssist is designed for privacy, you must:

1. **Never enter student names** in any field
2. **Use anonymous identifiers** consistently
3. **Keep your mapping** (which ID = which student) secure and separate
4. **Review generated comments** before using them
5. **Don't include identifying info** in context notes

## Maintaining Your Mapping

You'll need to track which anonymous ID corresponds to which student. Keep this mapping:

- In a separate, secure document
- Following your school's data protection policies
- Accessible only to you

**Example mapping (keep separate from TeachAssist):**

| Anonymous ID | Student Name | Class |
|--------------|--------------|-------|
| Student_A | [Name] | Period 2 |
| Student_B | [Name] | Period 2 |

## Batch Entry Tips

When entering data for multiple students:

1. **Prepare data first** - Have levels ready before starting
2. **Use consistent IDs** - Same format throughout
3. **Process in batches** - By class or criterion
4. **Review as you go** - Catch errors early

## What If You Made a Mistake?

**Accidentally entered a name?**
- The data only exists in your current session
- Clear the form or start fresh
- No persistent record was created

**Need to update achievement levels?**
- Simply re-enter the data
- Generate a new draft
- Previous drafts aren't saved

## Integration with Your Workflow

**Before TeachAssist:**
1. Assess student work
2. Determine achievement levels
3. Note any special observations

**In TeachAssist:**
4. Enter anonymous data
5. Generate draft comments
6. Copy drafts to your system

**After TeachAssist:**
7. Add student names in your official system
8. Personalize and finalize comments
9. Submit through school channels
