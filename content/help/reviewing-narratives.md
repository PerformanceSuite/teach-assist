# Reviewing and Editing Narratives

AI-generated narrative drafts are starting points. Your review and editing transforms them into authentic, personalized comments that reflect your knowledge of each student.

## The Review Process

### Step 1: Read the Full Draft

Before editing, read the complete draft:

- Does it capture the overall picture accurately?
- Does the tone feel appropriate?
- Are there any obvious errors?

### Step 2: Check Accuracy

Verify that the draft correctly reflects the data you entered:

**Check achievement descriptions:**
- Do the words match the levels?
- Is the progression logical?
- Are strengths and growth areas accurately identified?

**Check criteria coverage:**
- Is each criterion addressed?
- Is the weighting appropriate?
- Are any criteria over or under-emphasized?

### Step 3: Add Personalization

This is where your professional expertise shines:

**Add specific examples:**
> Generic: "Shows strong inquiry skills"
> Personalized: "Shows strong inquiry skills, particularly evident in the ecosystem investigation where she developed and tested three different hypotheses"

**Include context:**
> Generic: "Needs support with data analysis"
> Personalized: "Needs support with data analysis, especially when working with larger data sets - we're working on graphing strategies together"

**Add your voice:**
Adjust language to match how you typically communicate with families.

### Step 4: Verify Appropriateness

Before finalizing, check:

- **Tone:** Professional, supportive, growth-oriented?
- **Balance:** Strengths acknowledged alongside growth areas?
- **Specificity:** Enough detail to be meaningful?
- **Length:** Appropriate for your school's expectations?

## Common Edits to Make

### Strengthening Weak Phrases

**Before:** "The student did well in some areas"
**After:** "This student demonstrates consistent strength in experimental design and scientific reasoning"

### Adding Specificity

**Before:** "Needs to improve in this area"
**After:** "Focusing on developing data analysis skills, particularly interpreting graphs and identifying trends"

### Softening Overly Critical Language

**Before:** "Failed to demonstrate understanding"
**After:** "Is developing understanding and would benefit from additional practice with..."

### Making Growth-Oriented

**Before:** "Struggled with calculations"
**After:** "Is building calculation skills and making progress with the support of step-by-step scaffolds"

## What to Look For

### Red Flags in Generated Drafts

**Overly generic language:**
- "Good student"
- "Works hard"
- "Needs improvement"

Fix: Add specific evidence and examples.

**Tone mismatches:**
- Too formal or stiff
- Too casual
- Inconsistent voice

Fix: Rewrite in your natural communication style.

**Misaligned content:**
- Growth areas that don't match low scores
- Missing coverage of criteria
- Overemphasis on weaknesses

Fix: Verify against source data and rebalance.

**Unnatural phrasing:**
- Awkward sentence structures
- Repetitive language
- Jargon without explanation

Fix: Rewrite for readability.

### Quality Markers to Preserve

**Good structure:**
- Clear organization by criterion
- Logical flow from strengths to growth areas
- Forward-looking conclusion

**Accurate synthesis:**
- Criteria descriptors accurately represented
- Achievement levels appropriately described
- Consistent with entered data

## Editing Workflow Tips

### Use Track Changes

If your school system supports it:
1. Generate draft into a document
2. Use track changes while editing
3. Review changes before finalizing

This helps you see what you modified.

### Keep Original for Comparison

Sometimes it helps to see:
- What the AI generated
- What you changed
- Why you made those changes

### Batch Similar Students

When editing multiple comments:
1. Group students with similar achievement patterns
2. Edit one thoroughly
3. Use patterns for similar cases
4. Still personalize each individually

### Time Management

**Fast edits (2-3 minutes):**
- Accurate draft, just needs personalization
- Add one specific example
- Minor tone adjustments

**Medium edits (5-7 minutes):**
- Structural reorganization needed
- Multiple examples to add
- Tone overhaul

**Significant rewrite (10+ minutes):**
- Major accuracy issues
- Fundamental tone problems
- Consider regenerating with better input data

## Final Checklist

Before using any narrative comment:

- [ ] Achievement descriptions match entered data
- [ ] All criteria are addressed appropriately
- [ ] At least one specific example included
- [ ] Growth areas phrased constructively
- [ ] Tone matches your communication style
- [ ] Length meets school expectations
- [ ] No student names accidentally left in (from your mapping)
- [ ] Proofread for grammar and clarity

## When to Regenerate vs. Edit

**Regenerate when:**
- Fundamental accuracy issues
- Completely wrong tone
- Missing major criteria
- You entered data incorrectly

**Edit when:**
- Good foundation, needs personalization
- Minor accuracy adjustments
- Tone tweaking
- Adding examples and context
