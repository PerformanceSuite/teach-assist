# Interpreting Advisory Feedback

Inner Council advisors provide structured recommendations. Here's how to read, evaluate, and apply their feedback effectively.

## Response Structure

Each advisor response includes:

**1. Direct Answer**
The main response to your question.

**2. Reasoning**
Why the advisor is making this recommendation.

**3. Suggested Actions**
Specific next steps you could take.

**4. Citations**
References to your uploaded sources (when applicable).

**5. Considerations**
Caveats, limitations, or additional factors to consider.

## Reading Critically

### Check the Source Grounding

Advice grounded in your sources is more reliable:

**Well-grounded:**
> "Based on the NGSS standards you uploaded, this lesson addresses MS-PS2-1 by..."

**Less grounded:**
> "Generally speaking, forces units should include..."

The first response cites your specific materials. The second is generic.

### Note Confidence Language

Advisors signal their confidence level:

**High confidence:**
- "The standard explicitly requires..."
- "Your IEP document specifies..."

**Moderate confidence:**
- "This approach typically supports..."
- "Based on the framework, this likely..."

**Lower confidence:**
- "One possible approach might be..."
- "Without more information, I'd suggest..."

### Watch for Assumptions

Advisors may make assumptions. Notice them:

> "Assuming your students have prior experience with free-body diagrams..."

If the assumption doesn't hold, the advice may need adjustment.

## Evaluating Recommendations

### The Teacher Authority Filter

Every recommendation should pass through your professional judgment:

1. **Does this fit my students?** You know them; the AI doesn't.
2. **Does this fit my context?** School culture, resources, time constraints.
3. **Does this fit my expertise?** Your teaching style and strengths.
4. **Does this feel right?** Trust your professional instincts.

### When Advice Doesn't Fit

It's okay to disagree. Options:

**Push back:**
> "That won't work because my students don't have access to lab equipment. What alternatives could I use?"

**Request adjustment:**
> "I need a shorter activity. Can you suggest a 15-minute version?"

**Take what's useful:**
Use the parts that work, discard what doesn't.

## Applying Feedback

### Step 1: Identify the Core Insight

What's the main takeaway?

Example:
> Advisor says: "Your lesson plan covers MS-PS2-1 but doesn't address MS-PS2-2. Consider adding an activity where students analyze force interactions between two objects, such as a Newton's Cradle demonstration."

Core insight: Gap in MS-PS2-2 coverage, specifically force interactions.

### Step 2: Adapt to Your Context

Take the insight, not the exact suggestion:

- Newton's Cradle not available? Use collision carts.
- No equipment? Use video analysis.
- Short on time? Use a discussion instead of demonstration.

### Step 3: Implement and Iterate

Try the approach, observe results, adjust as needed.

## Common Feedback Types

### Alignment Feedback (Standards Guardian)

**What to look for:**
- Which standards are covered
- Which standards are missing
- Strength of alignment (partial vs. full)

**Action:** Address gaps, strengthen weak alignments.

### Accessibility Feedback (Differentiation Architect)

**What to look for:**
- Specific accommodation suggestions
- UDL principles applied
- Multiple means of engagement/representation/action

**Action:** Implement accommodations, create accessible versions.

### Assessment Feedback (Assessment Designer)

**What to look for:**
- Alignment between assessment and objectives
- Variety of assessment methods
- Feedback strategy recommendations

**Action:** Revise assessments, add formative checks.

### Planning Feedback (Curriculum Strategist)

**What to look for:**
- Sequencing recommendations
- Pacing suggestions
- Connection opportunities

**Action:** Adjust unit order, modify timeline, add connections.

## Red Flags in Advice

Be cautious if an advisor:

- **Makes claims without citations** - Ask for sources
- **Suggests grading student work** - This is outside TeachAssist's scope
- **Gives generic advice** - Ask for specifics tied to your materials
- **Contradicts your sources** - Double-check the original document

## Building on Feedback

**Follow-up questions work well:**

Initial: "Does my lesson align with the standards?"
Follow-up: "You mentioned MS-PS2-2 is partially covered. What specific addition would strengthen it?"
Follow-up: "How could I assess that addition formatively?"

Chain consultations to go deeper.
