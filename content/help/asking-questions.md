# Asking Grounded Questions

TeachAssist answers questions using only your uploaded sources. This means no hallucinations, no generic advice - just information grounded in your actual materials.

## How Grounded Chat Works

1. You ask a question
2. TeachAssist searches your knowledge base
3. Relevant chunks are retrieved
4. An answer is generated citing those chunks
5. You see the answer with source citations

## Types of Questions

**Factual Retrieval**
> "What are the 8th grade standards for forces and motion?"

Direct lookup in your uploaded standards document.

**Synthesis Questions**
> "How does my lesson plan align with the uploaded standards?"

Compares multiple documents to give you insights.

**Explanation Requests**
> "Explain the UbD backwards design process based on my uploaded template."

Explains concepts using your source materials.

**Finding Specific Content**
> "Find the section about Newton's Third Law."

Locates and returns relevant passages.

## Writing Effective Questions

**Be Specific**

Less effective: "What are the standards?"
More effective: "What are the NGSS performance expectations for 8th grade physical science?"

**Include Context**

Less effective: "How should I teach this?"
More effective: "Based on the uploaded UbD template, what are the recommended stages for designing a unit on forces?"

**Reference Documents**

"According to the IEP accommodations document, what reading supports are recommended?"

**Ask One Thing at a Time**

Instead of: "What are the standards and how do I assess them and what activities should I use?"

Try three separate questions for clearer answers.

## Understanding Responses

Each response includes:

**Direct Answer**
The main response to your question.

**Citations**
References to specific source documents and sections.

**Relevant Excerpts**
Quoted passages that support the answer.

**Confidence Indicators**
When information is limited, TeachAssist acknowledges uncertainty.

## When Sources Don't Have the Answer

If your knowledge base doesn't contain relevant information, TeachAssist will say:

> "I don't have information about this in your uploaded sources."

This is a feature, not a bug. It prevents made-up answers.

**What to do:**
- Upload relevant materials
- Rephrase your question
- Try related terms

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Upload first** - Questions work best with a robust knowledge base
2. **Use natural language** - Ask like you'd ask a colleague
3. **Follow up** - Ask clarifying questions
4. **Be patient** - Complex questions may take a moment
5. **Check citations** - Verify the source material

## Example Conversation

**You:** What accommodations does the uploaded IEP suggest for reading comprehension?

**TeachAssist:** Based on the "IEP Accommodations - Student A" document, the following reading comprehension supports are recommended:

1. Extended time for reading passages (1.5x)
2. Text-to-speech option for lengthy texts
3. Graphic organizers for main idea and details
4. Chunking of longer texts into sections

**You:** How can I apply these in the upcoming forces unit?

**TeachAssist:** For the forces unit, you could...
