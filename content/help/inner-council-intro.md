## How the Council Works

1. **Choose an advisor** based on your question type
2. **Provide context** about what you're working on
3. **Ask your question** naturally
4. **Receive structured advice** grounded in your sources
5. **Apply your judgment** - you make all final decisions

## Key Principles

**Grounded in Your Sources**
Advisors reference your uploaded materials, not generic advice.

**Different Lenses**
Each advisor approaches problems from their expertise area.

**Teacher Authority**
Advisors suggest, you decide. Your professional judgment is paramount.

**No Grading**
Advisors never evaluate student work or assign scores.

## Getting the Most from Your Council

**Be specific**
"Review my lesson plan" is less helpful than "Does this lesson's objective align with NGSS MS-PS2-2?"

**Provide context**
Share what you're working on, your constraints, and your goals.

**Consult multiple advisors**
Different perspectives lead to better decisions.

**Push back when needed**
If advice doesn't fit your context, ask for alternatives.
