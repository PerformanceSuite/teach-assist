# Welcome to TeachAssist

TeachAssist is your teaching intelligence system designed to help you work smarter, not harder. Built by teachers, for teachers.

## What TeachAssist Does

**Knowledge Base**
Upload your curriculum standards, lesson plans, and teaching materials. TeachAssist learns from your sources and provides answers grounded in your actual documents.

**Grounded Chat**
Ask questions and get answers that cite your uploaded sources. No hallucinations, no generic advice - only information from your materials.

**Inner Council**
Consult specialized AI advisors who provide structured feedback from different perspectives: standards alignment, differentiation, assessment design, and curriculum strategy.

**Narrative Synthesis**
Generate draft report card comments and narrative feedback based on criteria. You review and edit - TeachAssist never grades.

## Core Principles

1. **Teacher Authority** - You make all final decisions. AI assists but never replaces professional judgment.

2. **Privacy First** - Student data stays private. TeachAssist is designed for FERPA compliance.

3. **Grounded Responses** - Every answer cites your sources. No made-up information.

4. **No AI Grading** - TeachAssist will never assign grades or scores to student work.
