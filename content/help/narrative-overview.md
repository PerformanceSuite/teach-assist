# Narrative Comment Synthesis

TeachAssist helps you draft report card comments and narrative feedback. You provide the criteria and data; TeachAssist generates a starting draft. You review, edit, and finalize.

## What Narrative Synthesis Does

**Generates draft comments** based on:
- Criteria you specify (standards, rubric levels, learning objectives)
- Achievement data you enter (anonymized)
- Your uploaded curriculum materials

**Does NOT:**
- Grade student work
- Assign scores or levels
- Make final judgments about student achievement
- Replace your professional assessment

## How It Works

1. **You select criteria** (e.g., IB MYP descriptors, state standards, custom rubric)
2. **You enter achievement data** (using FERPA-safe methods)
3. **TeachAssist generates** a draft comment synthesizing the data
4. **You review and edit** the draft to match your voice and knowledge of the student
5. **You use the final comment** in your report card system

## Important Boundaries

### TeachAssist Is a Draft Writer, Not a Grader

The distinction matters:

**Grading (TeachAssist will NOT do):**
- Looking at student work and assigning a score
- Deciding achievement levels
- Evaluating quality of student output

**Draft Writing (TeachAssist DOES):**
- Taking YOUR assessment data and generating prose
- Synthesizing criteria descriptors into readable comments
- Creating starting points for you to refine

### You Determine Achievement

Before using narrative synthesis:
1. **You assess** student work against criteria
2. **You determine** achievement levels or scores
3. **You enter** that data into TeachAssist
4. TeachAssist helps with the writing, not the judging

## When to Use Narrative Synthesis

**Good Use Cases:**
- Report card comment periods (high volume writing)
- Progress reports requiring narrative feedback
- IEP progress documentation
- Standards-based reporting

**Not Intended For:**
- Feedback on individual assignments (use grounded chat instead)
- Quick informal comments
- Situations where you haven't yet assessed the work

## Example Workflow

**Scenario:** End of term IB MYP Science reports

1. **Upload** IB MYP Science criteria document
2. **Enter student data:**
   - Student ID: Student_A
   - Criterion A (Knowing): Level 5
   - Criterion B (Inquiring): Level 6
   - Criterion C (Processing): Level 4
   - Criterion D (Reflecting): Level 5
3. **Generate draft:**
   > "This student demonstrates solid understanding of scientific concepts (Criterion A) and strong inquiry skills (Criterion B). They show developing ability in processing and evaluating data (Criterion C) and reflect thoughtfully on scientific work (Criterion D). Next steps include strengthening data analysis and interpretation skills."
4. **Review and personalize:**
   - Add specific examples you observed
   - Adjust tone to match your voice
   - Include context about specific units
5. **Use** the edited comment in your report card system

## Quality Expectations

Draft comments are starting points. They will:

**Do well:**
- Synthesize criteria descriptors accurately
- Maintain consistent structure
- Use professional language
- Suggest growth areas based on lower scores

**Need your editing:**
- Adding specific examples and observations
- Personalizing to your teaching voice
- Including context about classroom activities
- Ensuring accuracy about individual students
