# IB MYP Science Criteria Reference

Quick reference for IB MYP Sciences assessment criteria. Use this when entering achievement data for narrative synthesis or when consulting Inner Council advisors about standards alignment.

## The Four Criteria

| Criterion | Name | Focus |
|-----------|------|-------|
| A | Knowing and understanding | Scientific knowledge and concepts |
| B | Inquiring and designing | Scientific investigation design |
| C | Processing and evaluating | Data handling and analysis |
| D | Reflecting on the impacts of science | Scientific literacy and reflection |

## Criterion A: Knowing and Understanding

**What it assesses:**
- Knowledge of scientific facts and concepts
- Understanding of scientific theories and models
- Application of knowledge to solve problems
- Communication using scientific language

**Achievement Level Summary:**

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1-2 | Limited knowledge; struggles to apply concepts |
| 3-4 | Basic knowledge; can apply with support |
| 5-6 | Good knowledge; applies concepts independently |
| 7-8 | Excellent knowledge; applies and transfers effectively |

**Key words for narratives:** understands, knows, applies, explains, describes, identifies, recognizes, communicates

---

## Criterion B: Inquiring and Designing

**What it assesses:**
- Developing testable hypotheses
- Designing scientific investigations
- Identifying variables (independent, dependent, controlled)
- Writing clear, repeatable methods

**Achievement Level Summary:**

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1-2 | Limited inquiry skills; needs significant support |
| 3-4 | Basic inquiry skills; designs with guidance |
| 5-6 | Good inquiry skills; designs sound investigations |
| 7-8 | Excellent inquiry skills; designs rigorous investigations |

**Key words for narratives:** hypothesizes, designs, investigates, identifies variables, develops methods, plans, inquires

---

## Criterion C: Processing and Evaluating

**What it assesses:**
- Collecting and organizing data
- Presenting data appropriately (tables, graphs)
- Analyzing and interpreting results
- Evaluating validity and reliability
- Suggesting improvements

**Achievement Level Summary:**

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1-2 | Limited data skills; basic recording only |
| 3-4 | Basic data skills; organizes and presents with support |
| 5-6 | Good data skills; analyzes and interprets effectively |
| 7-8 | Excellent data skills; sophisticated analysis and evaluation |

**Key words for narratives:** collects, organizes, presents, analyzes, interprets, evaluates, concludes, suggests improvements

---

## Criterion D: Reflecting on the Impacts of Science

**What it assesses:**
- Understanding connections between science and society
- Evaluating implications of scientific developments
- Applying scientific knowledge to real-world issues
- Making informed decisions about scientific issues

**Achievement Level Summary:**

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1-2 | Limited reflection; struggles to see connections |
| 3-4 | Basic reflection; identifies some connections |
| 5-6 | Good reflection; analyzes impacts thoughtfully |
| 7-8 | Excellent reflection; sophisticated analysis of implications |

**Key words for narratives:** reflects, evaluates, considers, analyzes impacts, discusses implications, applies to real world

## Using Criteria with TeachAssist

### For Narrative Synthesis

When entering data:
```
Criterion A: [Level 1-8]
Criterion B: [Level 1-8]
Criterion C: [Level 1-8]
Criterion D: [Level 1-8]
```

The generated narrative will:
- Describe achievement at each level accurately
- Identify relative strengths (higher levels)
- Suggest growth areas (lower levels)
- Use appropriate MYP language

### For Inner Council Consultations

**Standards Guardian:**
> "Does my forces unit address all four MYP criteria?"

**Assessment Designer:**
> "How can I assess Criterion B in the upcoming lab?"

**Differentiation Architect:**
> "How can I support a student struggling with Criterion C?"

### Example Narrative Output

**Input:**
- Criterion A: 6
- Criterion B: 7
- Criterion C: 4
- Criterion D: 5

**Generated draft:**
> "This student demonstrates strong scientific knowledge and understanding (Criterion A), consistently applying concepts to explain phenomena. They show excellent inquiry skills (Criterion B), designing rigorous investigations with clearly identified variables. Data processing and evaluation (Criterion C) is an area for growth, particularly in analyzing results and drawing evidence-based conclusions. They reflect thoughtfully on the impacts of science (Criterion D), making connections between scientific developments and real-world implications."

## MYP Grade Boundaries (General)

| MYP Grade | Typical Criterion Total (out of 32) |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| 7 | 28-32 |
| 6 | 24-27 |
| 5 | 19-23 |
| 4 | 15-18 |
| 3 | 10-14 |
| 2 | 6-9 |
| 1 | 1-5 |

*Note: Actual boundaries vary by school and assessment.*
