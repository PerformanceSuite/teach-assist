## Customizing Shortcuts

Currently, keyboard shortcuts are not customizable. This feature may be added in a future update.

If you have specific shortcut needs or conflicts, please provide feedback through the Settings menu.

## Accessibility Notes

**For users who cannot use keyboard shortcuts:**
- All actions are available through mouse/trackpad
- Command Palette provides searchable access to all features
- Screen reader compatible navigation available

**Modifier key alternatives:**
- Mac: Use `Cmd` key
- Windows/Linux: Use `Ctrl` key
- All shortcuts follow platform conventions

## Troubleshooting

**Shortcuts not working?**

1. **Check focus:** Make sure TeachAssist window is focused
2. **Check conflicts:** Other apps may capture the shortcut
3. **Check modifier:** Use `Cmd` on Mac, `Ctrl` on Windows
4. **Try Command Palette:** `Cmd+K` should always work

**Browser shortcuts interfering?**

Some browser shortcuts take priority. If a shortcut doesn't work:
- Try the Command Palette (`Cmd+K`)
- Use the mouse/trackpad alternative
- Check browser extension conflicts

## Learning Shortcuts

**Start with three:**
1. `Cmd+K` - Command Palette (gateway to everything)
2. `Cmd+J` - Chat (your most-used feature)
3. `Cmd+/` - Help (when you need guidance)

Master these, then add more as you become comfortable.
