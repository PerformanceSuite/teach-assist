# Choosing the Right Advisor

Each Inner Council advisor has distinct expertise. Choosing the right one leads to more useful advice.

## Quick Selection Guide

| Your Question About | Best Advisor |
|---------------------|--------------|
| "Does this meet standards?" | Standards Guardian |
| "How do I support this learner?" | Differentiation Architect |
| "How should I assess this?" | Assessment Designer |
| "How does this fit the big picture?" | Curriculum Strategist |

## Decision Flowchart

**Start here: What's your primary concern?**

**Alignment & Coverage**
"Am I teaching the right things?"
--> **Standards Guardian**

**Student Diversity**
"How do I reach all learners?"
--> **Differentiation Architect**

**Evaluation & Feedback**
"How do I know if they learned it?"
--> **Assessment Designer**

**Planning & Sequencing**
"What's the best order and approach?"
--> **Curriculum Strategist**

**Keywords in your question:** plan, sequence, pace, connect, unit, big picture, year-long

## When Multiple Advisors Apply

Sometimes your question spans multiple areas. Here's how to handle it:

**Option 1: Start with one, then consult another**

First: "Does my forces unit cover the standards?" --> Standards Guardian
Then: "How should I assess these standards?" --> Assessment Designer

**Option 2: Reframe the question**

Instead of: "Help me plan this unit" (too broad)
Try: "What standards should this unit address?" --> Standards Guardian
And: "How should I sequence the learning activities?" --> Curriculum Strategist

**Option 3: Get multiple perspectives**

Ask the same question to different advisors:
- Standards Guardian: "Review my lesson plan"
- Differentiation Architect: "Review my lesson plan"

You'll get different feedback based on each advisor's lens.

## Common Mistakes

**Going to the wrong advisor**
"How do I accommodate a student?" --> Don't ask Standards Guardian
"What standard does this meet?" --> Don't ask Assessment Designer

**Questions that are too vague**
"Is this lesson good?" --> Good for what? Alignment? Accessibility? Assessment?

**Skipping context**
Advisors need to know what you're working on to give relevant advice.

## Getting Second Opinions

It's often valuable to consult multiple advisors:

1. **Standards Guardian** confirms alignment
2. **Differentiation Architect** ensures accessibility
3. **Assessment Designer** validates evaluation approach
4. **Curriculum Strategist** checks big-picture fit

This multi-perspective approach catches blind spots.
