# TeachAssist Bundle Application Instructions (Claude Code)

Follow these instructions **exactly**.

## 0) Preconditions
- You are in a clean local folder intended to become the TeachAssist repo.
- The user will remove any existing PRD so the folder is clean.

## 1) Apply the bundle
1. Unzip the provided bundle into the target folder (repo root).
2. Ensure these files exist at repo root:
   - PRD.md
   - package.json
   - app/ (Next.js App Router)
   - docs/

## 2) Initialize git + set remote
From repo root:
```bash
git init
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/PerformanceSuite/teach-assist.git
```

## 3) Install + basic verification
```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
```

- Do NOT commit secrets.
- Populate `.env.local` with placeholder values (leave empty if you cannot access secrets).

Run:
```bash
npm run build
```

If build passes, proceed. If build fails, fix issues and re-run.

## 4) Commit + push
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "TeachAssist v0.1 scaffold: PRD + Next.js app + Google OAuth (NextAuth)"
git push -u origin main
```

## 5) Vercel notes (do not perform unless asked)
- Connect the GitHub repo to Vercel.
- Set env vars in Vercel: GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, TEACHASSIST_ALLOWED_EMAILS.
- Configure Google OAuth redirect: https://<vercel-domain>/api/auth/callback/google

## 6) Cleanup (important)
After applying, **delete the zip file from the Downloads folder** (or wherever it was downloaded).

## 7) Report back
Reply with:
- `[BUNDLE APPLIED]`
- whether `npm run build` succeeded
- the git commit hash
- confirmation the zip was deleted from Downloads
