## Development History

**v0.1 Development:** 2026-01-24 to 2026-01-25

The v0.1 pilot was built using a parallel agent execution strategy with 4 specialized agents:

1. **Agent 1:** Backend Testing Specialist
2. **Agent 2:** Welcome Dashboard Specialist
3. **Agent 3:** AI Assistant + Help Center Specialist
4. **Agent 4:** Core Pages + API Integration Specialist

This approach reduced development time from an estimated 8-12 hours to 3-4 hours.
