## Overview
Generative AI tools like ChatGPT are not here to replace teachers. Think of AI as a co-design partner (“force multiplier”) using a Backward Design / UbD workflow.

## Getting Started: Training Your AI Co-Design Partner
Includes a reusable “Introduction Prompt” template and guidance on providing student context, goals, and tasks.

## 1. Transfer Goals
Defines transfer goals and provides prompts and evaluation questions for refining goals.

## 2. Authentic Performance Tasks
Defines performance tasks, provides brainstorming prompts, and uses the GRASPS framework to build a full task.

## 3. Planning Learning Experiences
Generates and refines inquiry-based, student-centered activities aligned to transfer goals and performance tasks.

## 4. Best Practices & Ethical Use
- Give AI a persona
- Be specific with details
- Iterate with follow-up questions
- Break tasks into steps
- Protect privacy; never share confidential student info with public LLMs
